## Running the App Locally

There one environment variable the app needs. Create an `.env` file with variables for `SKYFLOW_BEARER_TOKEN`. This value can be obtained after creating a free account with [Skyflow](https://www.skyflow.com/). Once you have an account created and your `.env` file populated with your bearer token, follow these instructions to start the app.

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## NPM Scripts

- `format`: Formats the code using Prettier
- `format-watch`: Formats the code using Prettier in watch mode
- `start`: Starts the app locally with a Node Express.js server running on port 3000
